# NLP-Amazon-Reviews

The aim of this project is applying natural language processing and text analytics skills to provide insight on the data provided and to propose
a categorization system that can automatically rate similar text reviews. 
Given a data set of text reviews and the corresponding ratings provided by the user. The ratings score
different food products to 1 (low rating) up till 5 (maximum rating).
This can be considered a multi-class classification problem where your classes are the scores provided
by the user {1,2,3,4,5}. The features are the text reviews.

This project is split into several tasks as the following:

Task 1: Text Exploration, Visualization, Processing and Normalization.
Task 2: Vector space Model, feature representation and Model training, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
Task 3: Modelling text as a Sequence.
Task 4: Using pre-trained word-embeddings such as word2vec.
Task 5: Topic Modelling using LDA.
